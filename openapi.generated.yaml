  title: Self-Modifying Pair Programmer
  description: >
    The Pair Programmer is a plugin that enables ChatGPT to collaborate with
    users in a pair programming manner. This plugin grants ChatGPT the
    capability to manage projects and execute terminal commands.


    A unique feature of this plugin is the "system" tool, which provides ChatGPT
    access to the plugin's own source code. This access allows ChatGPT to view,
    interpret, and even modify the plugin's code, enabling it to adapt and
    extend its functionalities based on user needs.


    If a user's goals or tasks aren't addressed by the current toolset, ChatGPT
    can leverage this access to introduce new features or adjust existing ones.
    This adaptability ensures that ChatGPT can evolve in real-time, enhancing
    its assistance in coding and project management tasks.


    The Pair Programmer not only augments the interaction between ChatGPT and
    the user but also empowers ChatGPT with self-modification capabilities,
    ensuring a tailored and efficient collaboration.
