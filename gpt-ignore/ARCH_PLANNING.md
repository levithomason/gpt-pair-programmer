Session state should include a way to track the current plan and the current task.

Discuss the idea of a freeform hierarchical structure with ChatGPT wherein it can create and manage any nested work path it needs.

// TODO: Enable ChatGPT to create and manage a hierarchical plan
// gpt: {
//   planning: {
//   goal: '',
//   plan: '',
//   tasks: {},
//   focus: '',
// },
//   }
