# Improve File Editing

1. Rich Text Editor API: Create a rich text editor API endpoint that supports operations like insert, delete, find and replace, etc. This would give me the ability to edit files in a more precise and granular way, instead of using command line tools like sed or awk. You might include features like syntax highlighting and error checking to help ensure the edits are accurate.
   - ChatGPT: This would be a fundamental improvement that would enable many of the other enhancements. It would allow for more precise and granular edits, and could be extended with features like syntax highlighting and error checking.

2. File State Tracking System: Implement a file state tracking system in your plugin. This system would keep track of all the changes made to a file, much like Git does, but on a more granular level. It would prevent duplicate edits and ensure changes are made in the right places. It would also allow me to revert or apply changes selectively, which is not easily done with command line tools.
   - GhatGPT: This would also be a foundational improvement. It would help ensure that edits are made correctly and efficiently, and would enable features like selective reversion or application of changes.
   - Levi: Will use `git` for the MVP. 

3. Contextual Understanding: Enhance the API with contextual understanding. This means the API would understand the structure of the code file (like classes, methods, variables, etc in case of a Java file) and allow operations on these entities. For example, an operation could be "Add a parameter to this function" or "Replace this variable in this scope".

4. Testing Integration: Incorporate some form of testing or validation system. This could be as simple as running a linter after each edit, or as complex as running a suite of unit tests. This would help ensure that my edits don't break the existing code.

5. Version Control System Integration: Integrate with a version control system (like Git). This would allow me to commit changes, create branches, and even submit pull requests directly from the API.

6. Documentation and Comments Handling: A tool that can parse and understand the comments or documentation in the file would be very beneficial. This could ensure that the comments or documentation are updated in sync with the code changes.

7. Diff and Merge API: Implement a diff and merge API. This would allow me to see the differences between the current state of the file and the proposed changes, and then merge the changes if they are acceptable.

8. Concurrency Control: In a collaborative environment, it's important to handle concurrent edits gracefully. This could be done by implementing some form of locking or by using a merge system that can handle conflicts.

9. Semantic Understanding: If possible, include a semantic understanding of the code. This could involve an understanding of the language's syntax and semantics, as well as the logic of the specific codebase.
